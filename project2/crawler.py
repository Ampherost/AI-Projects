"""
In this file, you should test your Q-learning implementation on a robot crawler environment. 
It is suggested to test your code in the grid world environments before this one.

The package `matplotlib` is needed for the program to run.


The Crawler environment has discrete state and action spaces
and provides both model-based and model-free access.

It has the following properties:
    env.observation_space.n     # the number of states
    env.action_space.n          # the number of actions
  

Once a terminal state is reached the environment should be (re)initialized by
    s = env.reset()
where s is the initial state.
An experience (sample) can be collected from s by taking an action a as follows:
    s_, r, terminal, info = env.step(a)
where s_ is the resulted state by taking the action a,
      r is the reward achieved by taking the action a,
      terminal is a boolean flag to indicate if s_ is a terminal state, and
      info is just used to keep compatible with openAI gym library.


A Logger instance is provided for each function, through which you can
visualize the process of the algorithm.
You can visualize the value, v, and policy, pi, for the i-th iteration by
    logger.log(i, v, pi)

    Implement Q-learning to return a deterministic policy for all states.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env: CrawlerEnv
        the environment
    logger: app.grid_world.App.Logger
        a logger instance to perform test and record the iteration process.
    
    Returns
    -------
    pi: list or dict
        pi[s] should give a valid action,
        i.e. an integer in [0, env.action_space.n),
        as the optimal policy found by the algorithm for the state s.
